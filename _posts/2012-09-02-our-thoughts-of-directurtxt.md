### DirectUrTxt: Androids Best Text Message Manager

I recently made the switch from being a devoted iPhone user to a Samsung Galaxy SIII lover. I cannot tell you how amazed I am at the new phone. One of my favorites is that it is an Android device. Although on Android we lost Sparrow, one of the best email clients ever, we gained DirectUrTxt, an equally good text messaging manager.

## Thoughts

So we took some time to review the app and let it bake on our phone. Aside from using the Out-of-Office when we are vacation (which is one of the most amazing features ever), we found another use. We created automatic replies for McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King and more. That way, when someone messages us from the drive-thru, we don't have to think and our favorite meal gets ordered. We really recommend you download the free app, which doesn't allow for out-of-office or message forwarding, but all of your other options are available.

## The Good

- Forward messages to a group based on filter actions
- Message auto-replies
- Contact group management
- Out of Office feature is awesome, great for corporate America
- Filtering based on groups, numbers, time frames and keywords
- It actually works! (Unlike many others out there)

## The Bad

- No automated spam blocker (Automatically updated blacklist)
- No per-filter enable/disable
- No Exchange integration
