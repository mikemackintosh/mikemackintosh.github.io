### Introduction
Looking back at the technical side of Corporate America, is it interesting to find that not many people understand how the internet works. Web servers are what make the world-go-round and let you chat up your friends for countless hours. Spreading, or even gaining, this knowledge helps define an edge between the average employee and those with motivation. Just because your resumes' objective has the word motivated doesn't count. 

## Objectives
I personally feel that understanding how and why a web server works is need to know information for everyone. I recently created a virtual machine cluster to test some ideas in my lab, and thought "Hey! Let me toss the steps up on the web real quick, because the internet needs another LAMP tutorial!" **NOT!**. I wanted to walk through the steps of creating a server, why certain steps are needed or performed. The following few articles are part of a series which I plan to detial the simple steps to get a basic server up an running on Linux (\*nix) and some of the gotcha's you may experience.

## Installments
The installments of the series are as follows:

- [Part One - The Database (Percona/MySQL)](/web-server-basics-part-1-mysql)
- [Part Two - The Web Server (Apache)](/web-server-basics-part-2-apache)
- [Part Three - PHP (PHP5)](/web-server-basics-part-3-php)

## Conclusion
Learning how to configure and manage a web server can help you work and live smarter. Impress your co-workers and your management teams by showing them proving you know more than just the bare-minimum. Now you can prove it! Enjoy the read.
