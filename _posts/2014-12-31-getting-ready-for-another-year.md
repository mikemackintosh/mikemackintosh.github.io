title: Getting Ready For Another Year
---

We are only a few hours away from closing out 2014 here in NYC. To start the new year, we are going to change a few things up. I haven't been focusing only on PHP, as HighOnPHP suggests. As a result, I wanted to change up the mix and rebrand and simplify, simply to just [mikemackintosh](http://www.mikemackintosh.com).

Stay tuned for some pretty cool articles.
