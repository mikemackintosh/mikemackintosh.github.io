### Introduction
I was having a problem controlling the Brightness of my new Mini-Display Port Apple Cinema Display. After some digging, I stumbled upon this hard to find file which loads some kernel extensions to allow control of the ACD.

You can get the file from [Apple's website](http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Hardware_Test/EDID_Reset_Tool.dmg) directly.
