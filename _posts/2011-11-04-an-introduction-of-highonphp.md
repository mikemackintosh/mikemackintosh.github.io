## Background

HighOnPHP is designed to help other learn practical and useful ways to apply programming to everyday life. For example, integration has always been key to tackling many of my professional challenges. It has helped to better understand the need for additional skill sets in Corporate America. How many times in a job position have you thought, "I wish there was a better way to do this?" Simplification of daily job tasks will increase production. That increase in production will get you recognized.

## Objectives

You can integrate too! Help increase productivity and automate a webscript to backup configurations of network routers. Create an application to centralize provisioning data for customer trouble tickets. You can even simply manage a database of high-value data. One of the things I love most about PHP is it's versatility. We can create pages served by Apache, design GUI applications using GTK, and build CLI based utilities. Of course, everyone has their own opinions and thoughts, but I would like to share what has worked best for me. It is why I have chosen it to be my drug of choice. A couple of things I hope to share on HighOnPHP are the following:

  - Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques
  - Debugging and Troubleshooting Skills
  - Database Management
  - Service Integration
  - Creating and Understanding Web Services and API's
  - Assisted Networking Management

## Summary

Stick around, be patient and be curious. The more questions you ask, the better you will understand. Understanding anything from a different perspective enforces mastery of a skill. My goal is to post about things I have encountered and code snippets to makeour lives easier. I hope to really make this a second home for those who get HighOnPHP.
