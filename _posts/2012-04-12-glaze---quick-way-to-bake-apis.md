# What is Glaze?
Glaze is a newely launched service designed to take the legwork out of creating an API. It uses an easy-to-use, intuitive interface to guide you for the most part on how to create an API, controller, modifier and output data. We haven't seen anything like this before, and it's use comes in handy. You can get in touch with that at [www.mobilefrosting.com](http://www.mobilefrosting.com) or [www.yumglaze.com](http://www.yumglaze.com). You can follow them on twitter at [http://twitter.com/yumglaze](http://twitter.com/yumglaze). 
# Initial Thoughts

- **Pricing** - Pricing seems more than acceptable not only for the fact that you get an easy to use interface, but hosting too! They give you a "user.glazenet.com" URL to send all your requests to, and depending which plan, you can even use your own domain and SSL/Port
- **Interface** - The interface really hits upon all aspects you can think of when develpoing an API. Glaze, which is made by developers, understands the flow of creating an API. They walk you through creating the controller which receives data, mapping input varaiables and data to your 'modifiers' and mapping said modifiers to the database.
- **Support** - Being a project created by developers from the start, you are in good hands with support. You talk directly with the engineers who created and maintain the application. 
- **Reporting** - Built in you can track statistics on your application by using the API controllers most-frequently hit. They let you know which errors are commonly encountered, how many requests your application is serving a minute/hour/day/month, and they even let you export [planned for the next release]

# In Closing
Honestly, we ate it all up! Glaze really is a great app, with a lot of potential. Just a little more tweaking and it will be the next big thing! Enjoy.
