This is still one of my favorite write-ups on how to solve the generic problem of _*wtf*_. For the past year, I read this on a weekly basis to replay the task and keep my abilities sharp. Although I didn't write it and I wasn't involved in the event, I use this to help stay fresh on general concepts, which the writeup handles beautifully.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
