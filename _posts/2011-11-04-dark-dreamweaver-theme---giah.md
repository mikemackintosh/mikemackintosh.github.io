# Dreamweaver Themes

There are a lot of IDE's out there when it comes to programming. Each IDE has it's own syntax style defaults, and they are not always pretty. Along side of being pretty, it needs to be calming, relaxing and readable. I used to use Dreamweaver simply for the built in SVN+SSH, SFTP/FTP and Syntax Highlighting capabilities but since move to [Zend Studio](http://bit.ly/XZodD6).

Since I've recently been getting in touch with my [GIT](http://github.com/mikemackintosh) side, I stumbled upon their online editor and thought it was gorgeous! It gave me inspiration for a new Dreamweaver color scheme. Below, I have included a few screenshots of PHP and XML. The font I use on my Windows machine is called 'Anonymous Pro', which can be found on [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Anonymous-Pro).

On my iMac (SplugBox), I use one called [Terminal Dosis](http://www.impallari.com/terminaldosis), from Pablo Impallari, the designer of Lobster.

# Download You can download the files as follows:

- [Dreamweaver Giah Theme](http://www.highonphp.com/download/Dreamweaver CS5.5 Giah Theme.zip)

# Installation

I am going to be working on an installer but for the time being follow these steps:

  - **On Windows:**
  - Copy the file to: `%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Adobe\Dreamweaver CS5.5\en_US\Configuration\CodeColoring\`

  - **On Mac:**
  - Copy the file to: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS5.5/en_US/Configuration/CodeColoring/` &nbsp;

The background color will need to be set to `#0D0D0D` or whatever you would prefer via the Preferences window.

I enjoyed making this theme, and plan on making some more in the future. I have even began drafting a Dreamweaver Theme Generator, to let folks easily choose complimenting colors.

**Update**: I use Sublime Text 3 and vim now, so don't expect updates.
