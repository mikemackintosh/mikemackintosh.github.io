### Introduction
A lot of the traffic coming to [HighOnPHP](http://www.highonphp.com) has been looking for Dreamweaver Themes. Apparently, it is a very hot topic. We decided to take it one step further, and create an Online Theme Generator, that will generate an XML file with the colors of choice for CS and above versions. Currently, only PHP and HTML are supported, but in the next generation update, we will expand the supported languages further.
