### Introduction

I tossed together this pretty cool theme late last year. I ended up switching to Bashit since it saved me some headache and increased performance as many of my `.bashrc` calls were not optimized. In doing so, I ported my bash prompt at the time (with awesome color support) to bashit to take advantage of their pugins.
