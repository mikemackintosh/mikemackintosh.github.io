We are up to 3,000 views a month! Woohoo!

Also, I have been working on cleaning up a lot of the issues with the imported posts in some of my recent downtime. Things include 404's and truncated code snippets. As a result, I am migrating all code snippets to GitHub (so I hope they don't go out of business). 

If You run into an issue, shoot me a tweet [`@mikemackintosh`](https://twitter.com/mikemackintosh).
