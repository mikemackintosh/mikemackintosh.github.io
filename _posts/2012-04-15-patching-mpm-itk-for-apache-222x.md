### What is MPM-iTK?

`apache2-mpm-itk` (just `mpm-itk` for short) is an MPM (Multi-Processing Module) for the Apache web server. `mpm-itk` allows you to run each of your vhost under a separate uid and gid â€” in short, the scripts and configuration files for one vhost no longer have to be readable for all the other vhosts. To read more, check out the mpm's site: [http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/](http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/)
