### What's New In PHP 5.4.0?

The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.4.0. This release is a major leap forward in the 5.x series, and includes a large number of new features and bug fixes. Release Announcement: [http://www.php.net/releases/5_4_0.php](http://www.php.net/releases/5_4_0.php)Downloads: [http://php.net/downloads.php#v5.4.0](http://php.net/downloads.php#v5.4.0)ChangeLog: [http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.0](http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.0)

## Short Array Syntax
One of my favorite updates in 5.4 is the short array syntax. Being able to define an array with `[]` instead of `array()` is more of a cosmetic and ease of use update than a performance increase. 

```
// as of PHP 5.4 
$array = ["foo" => "bar", "bar" => "foo"];
```
