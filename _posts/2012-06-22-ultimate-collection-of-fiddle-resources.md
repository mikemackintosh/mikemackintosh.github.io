### Why Fiddle?

We are heavily engaged in the Open-Source and Q/A community which means we love to share code. Whether it is sharing a demo or assisting with the debugging of code, we need a way to share visually and collaborate logically. Fiddle resources provided just that. Below, I have compiled a list of Fiddle Resources which come with much appreciation and untold amounts of usefulness.
