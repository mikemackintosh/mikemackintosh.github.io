# Why Fiddle?

We are heavily engaged in the Open-Source and Q/A community which means we love to share code. Whether it is sharing a demo or assisting with the debugging of code, we need a way to share visually and collaborate logically. Fiddle resources provided just that. Below, I have compiled a list of Fiddle Resources which come with much appreciation and untold amounts of usefulness.

[reFiddle](http://www.refiddle.com) - A ReGex Fiddle reFiddle is a great resource for testing regular expressions.

[sqlFiddle](http://www.sqlfiddle.com) - An SQL Fiddle sqlFiddle is a good way to build schema, test queries and more for SQL services.

[jsFiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net) - A JavaScript Fiddle jsFiddle is an awesome resource for testing javascript code. As more are discovered, I will update the above list.
