If you work commonly enough with SSL, you know that verifying certificates and keys needs to be done before you push a configuration change to a server. Thankfully `nginx` has the `configtest` flag set in the `restart` command, to prevent you from shutting down a broken configuration.

Below, I have included a really simple script that will take all the `.crt` files in a directly, and match them up with `.key` files, and validate the modulus' `md5sum`.

On failure, it will spit out the cert/key combo that doesn't match like below:
